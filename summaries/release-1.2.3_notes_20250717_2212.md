### PR #2 - Embed codebase context for RAG
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Title: Embed codebase context for RAG

Key Points:

- This Pull Request adds a script that integrates the project source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval using LlamaIndex.
- The script primarily loads the .env file for the OpenAI API Key, sets the project root directory, and excludes specific directories from indexing.
- It gathers all the Python files from the project root, excluding the specified directories, and writes them into a temporary folder.
- The script then reads these files using SimpleDirectoryReader, creates a vector index from these documents, and saves the index.

Why It Matters:

- The addition of this script enhances the codebase's accessibility by embedding it into a vector index. This embedding offers a robust way to perform semantic retrieval of the codebase.
- The script's ability to exclude specific directories from indexing allows more control over what parts of the codebase are semantically retrievable, ensuring that only relevant code gets indexed.
- By loading the OpenAI API Key, this script potentially opens up the path for leveraging OpenAI's capabilities within the project.

Please note that this PR does not involve updating any external Terraform modules, so there's no anticipated impact on the infrastructure.

### PR #3 - no context (test)
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

This Pull Request (PR) by teaton12 introduces significant enhancements to the `generate_release_notes.py` script. 

Key Changes:
- The script now loads the index from disk, using the `load_index_from_storage` function from the `llama_index.core` module.
- The diff text from the PR is now used to query the loaded index, allowing for code context extraction.
- The prompt construction for PR summaries has been improved to include relevant code context in addition to the PR title, body, and diff.
- The script now utilizes the "gpt-4" OpenAI model instead of "gpt-3.5-turbo" for generating PR summaries, potentially leading to more accurate and detailed summaries.
- The parameters for the completion process have been adjusted to generate more extensive outputs.
- A typo in the script has been rectified: 'marged' has been corrected to 'merged'.

Impact:
- These changes will significantly enhance the accuracy and context-awareness of the generated PR summaries, leading to more informative release notes.
- The correction of the typo will lead to more professional output.
- The switch to the "gpt-4" model could impact the runtime and resource utilization, but it is expected to result in better PR summaries.

This PR does not involve any updates to external Terraform modules, so there's no direct impact on infrastructure. However, the improvements in the script's output quality could indirectly influence infrastructure management decisions based on the release notes.

### PR #4 - PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

This PR significantly enhances the PR summarisation tool by introducing configuration and output modifications. The key points are:

- **Environment/Configuration Handling**: The addition of 'config.py' centralizes environment variables and configuration settings. This step enhances maintainability and eases the handling of various settings.

- **Detailed Release Notes Generation**: The modified 'generate_release_notes.py' now creates detailed release notes for each tagged PR. These notes are timestamped and stored under a new directory 'summaries/', providing a better traceability of outputs.

- **Single, Context-Aware Summary**: A new script 'generate_combined_summary.py' has been added which generates a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs.

- **Improved PR Summarisation**: The updated 'generate_release_notes.py' now loads an index from the disk, queries the index with diff text, and constructs prompts using relevant code context and PR information. This process significantly improves the PR summarisation accuracy and context relevance.

- **OpenAI Model Update**: The PR also switches the OpenAI model used for generating PR summaries from "gpt-3.5-turbo" to "gpt-4". The parameters for the completion process have also been adjusted, which may result in improved AI outputs.

Impact:

By centralizing the configuration handling, enhancing the output system, and improving the PR summarisation process, this PR brings increased efficiency, traceability, and maintainability to the PR summarisation tool. This will help in reducing manual effort in summarising PRs and enhance the accuracy and context relevance of the generated summaries. It's important to note that the switch to the 'gpt-4' model and adjusted parameters may impact the AI outputs, which should be monitored for quality and relevance.

### PR #5 - enhancements
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

Title: Enhancements

This PR implements several changes primarily aimed at codebase organisation and the introduction of a new functionality in the `generate_release_notes.py` script:

- Configuration has been extracted and placed into a separate `config.py` file. This improves codebase maintainability and readability by centralising all configuration-related code.
- Python scripts have been moved into a `scripts` folder. This enhances codebase organisation making it easier to navigate.
- The `context_embed.py` script has been extended to store vectors for the entire repository. This may improve the quality of indexing and retrieving information from the codebase.
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been modified with the introduction of a new function `score_pr` that calculates a score for each PR based on certain characteristics. This could potentially help prioritise PRs based on their scores, thereby improving efficiency in handling PRs.

Impact:

These changes do not directly impact infrastructure as they are primarily codebase organisational changes and functionality additions. However, these changes are expected to improve the efficiency of handling PRs and the quality of indexing and retrieving information from the codebase. 

Please note, if there are dependencies on the original location of the python scripts or the `config.py` file, you may need to update the dependencies to reflect the new locations.

Moreover, the vector store extension for the entire repo could potentially require more storage space. Ensure you have enough resources to handle this change.

### PR #7 - embed external modules to add more context to summariser
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request (PR) Summary:

- **Title**: Embed external modules to add more context to the summariser
- **Author**: teaton12
- **Date**: Tue, 15 Jul 2025 22:20:32 +0100

PR Objectives:

- The PR aims to provide more context to the summarising agent by scanning for external modules in the codebase, reviewing the git diff, and pulling those tags locally.
- It introduces a new `module_tags.json` file in the `.external_modules/` directory to keep track of the git tags of the external modules.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.external_modules/` directory but includes the `module_tags.json` file.
- It also includes a `README.md` file to provide information about the project.

Potential Impact on Infrastructure:

- As the PR involves changes to external Terraform modules, it has potential implications on the infrastructure. The `module_tags.json` file tracks the version/tag of the modules used, which means any changes in the external modules could potentially affect the infrastructure components defined by these modules.
- However, the PR also ensures that these tags are pulled locally, which helps in keeping a stable reference and mitigating the risk of breaking changes introduced in the external modules.

Notable Changes:

- Creation of `module_tags.json` file under `.external_modules/` directory.
- Modification of `.gitignore` file to exclude `.external_modules/` but include `module_tags.json`.
- Addition of the `README.md` file for project information.
- Numerous changes to release notes and summary scripts, likely to accommodate the context provided by the external modules.
