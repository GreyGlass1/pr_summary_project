# Release Notes for Version 1.2.3

## Project: PR Summarisation Tool Enhancements

1. **Update Repo** (#1): The repository name in the `generate_release_notes.py` file has been updated from "GreyGlass1/test_repo" to "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project".

2. **Embed Codebase Context for RAG** (#2): A new script, `context_embed.py`, has been added to improve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by embedding the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval.

3. **No Context (Test)** (#3): The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to load an index from disk and query this index with the diff text. The queried context and PR's information are used to construct a prompt for the OpenAI model to generate a PR summary. The OpenAI model version has been updated to "gpt-4".

4. **PR Introduces Configuration and Output Enhancements to the PR Summarisation Tool** (#4): This PR introduces several enhancements including a new configuration handling via `config.py`, detailed release notes for each tagged PR stored under the `summaries/` directory, and a new script `generate_combined_summary.py` that generates a single, context-aware summary of all included PRs.

5. **Enhancements** (#5): The `config.py` and `context_embed.py` scripts have been moved to a new `scripts` directory and their functionalities have been enhanced. The `config.py` file now includes additional configurations and paths, while the `context_embed.py` file has been updated to read the entire project files and generate an index.

6. **New Score Functionality** (#6): A new function `score_pr` has been added to the `generate_release_notes.py` script. This function calculates a score out of 100 and provides a reason string based on certain PR characteristics. The score and reason for each PR are now included in the release notes.

## Potential Risks
- The new scoring system might affect the PR evaluation process, as it deducts points if the PR is not merged, lacks a description, does not have labels, or has a generic title.
- The change in the OpenAI model version to "gpt-4" might affect the PR summarisation output.
- The relocation and enhancement of `config.py` and `context_embed.py` scripts could potentially affect their functionalities if not properly tested.
