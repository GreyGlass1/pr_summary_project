# üìù Release Notes for release-1.2.3

### PR #1 - update repo
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request (PR) Title: "Update Repo"

Key Changes:
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to change the repository name from "GreyGlass1/test_repo" to "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project".

Significance:
- This PR ensures that the `generate_release_notes.py` script fetches data from the correct repository, "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project", enhancing the accuracy of the generated release notes.
- With this update, any features, bug fixes, or improvements done in the "pr_summary_project" repository will be accurately reflected in the release notes.

Potential Impact:
- The change does not involve updating external Terraform modules or changing any git tag in a module source, hence there is no direct impact on the infrastructure.
- However, it is crucial to ensure the updated repository contains all the necessary code and modules that are to be reflected in the release notes. If not, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the release notes may be compromised.

### PR #2 - Embed codebase context for RAG
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

Title: Embed codebase context for RAG

Purpose: This Pull Request introduces a new script that enables embedding of the project's codebase into a Chroma vector index for semantic retrieval, which can significantly enhance the code search and navigation.

Key Changes:

- Added a new Python script, `context_embed.py`, which encompasses the entire functionality of indexing the codebase.
- The script loads the necessary environment variables from the .env file required for the OpenAI API key.
- The script is designed to exclude certain directories from indexing such as 'venv', 'index', '.git', and '.vscode'.
- It gathers all .py files from the project root excluding the specified directories, then writes these into a temporary folder.
- The SimpleDirectoryReader is used to load the .py files, which are then embedded into the Chroma vector index using the LlamaIndex library's VectorStoreIndex class.
- The index is persisted in the specified directory for future use.

Impact: This change will enhance the project's code navigation and search capabilities by leveraging semantic retrieval. The codebase can now be more efficiently searched, which can help in debugging, feature development, and overall code maintenance. The change does not impact any external Terraform modules, so there is no immediate impact on the infrastructure.

Note: In the future, carefully manage the list of directories to be excluded from the indexing process to ensure relevant code is not unintentionally overlooked.

### PR #3 - no context (test)
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

- The PR improves the `generate_release_notes.py` script by adding an index loading functionality from the disk and using it to query the diff text for relevant code context.
- The PR introduces the use of a new OpenAI model, "gpt-4", with adjusted parameters for generating PR summaries.
- The script now uses the relevant code context and PR information to construct prompts.
- The PR also fixes a typo in the script, changing 'marged' to 'merged'.

Impact and Importance:

- The addition of an index loading functionality from the disk and querying of the diff text will enable the generation of more context-aware summaries for the pull requests. This will improve the efficiency and accuracy of the release notes creation process.
- The use of the "gpt-4" OpenAI model with adjusted parameters may enhance the quality of the generated PR summaries, providing more value to the end user.
- The typo correction improves the script's readability and understandability.

Please note that this PR does not involve changes to any Terraform modules and as such does not have direct implications for infrastructure.

### PR #4 - PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

- This pull request (PR) introduces several enhancements to the pull request summarisation tool, improving its utility, maintainability, and traceability of outputs.
- The changes include:
  - The addition of `config.py` for centralising environment and configuration variable handling, leading to improved maintainability.
  - Updates to `generate_release_notes.py` which now generates detailed release notes for each tagged PR. These notes are stored under `summaries/` with timestamped filenames, improving traceability.
  - An update to `generate_combined_summary.py` that produces a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs using embedded codebase context and OpenAI.
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been enhanced to load an index from disk, query the index with diff text, and construct prompts using relevant code context and PR information.
- The OpenAI model used for generating PR summaries has been switched to "gpt-4", with adjusted parameters for the completion process.
  
Why It Matters:

- Streamlining the summary generation process: The updates in this PR automate and improve the process of generating summaries for PRs, making it easier for the team to understand the changes introduced in each PR.
- Improved maintainability: By centralising the handling of environment and config variables, the code becomes easier to manage and update.
- Enhanced traceability of outputs: With the storage of detailed release notes for each tagged PR in timestamped files, tracking the history and context of changes becomes easier.
- Release-specific context: The update to `generate_combined_summary.py` ensures that the summary accounts for the specific context of the release, making it more informative and accurate.
- Use of a more advanced model for generating PR summaries: The switch to "gpt-4" improves the quality of the generated summaries, making them more useful for understanding the implications of each PR.

### PR #5 - enhancements
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Summary:

Title: Enhancements

Key Changes:

- Moved the `config.py` and `context_embed.py` files from the root directory into a new `scripts` directory.
- The `generate_release_notes.py` and `summariser.py` scripts were also relocated to the `scripts` directory.
- Introduced a new functionality to the `context_embed.py` script to read and index the entire repository.
  
Impact:

- The reorganization of files and scripts into a dedicated `scripts` directory improves codebase structure and navigability.
- The new indexing functionality in `context_embed.py` enhances the project's searchability and data retrieval process.
  
Please note that this PR does not involve any changes to external Terraform modules, so there are no immediate infrastructure impacts associated with these modifications.

### PR #6 - new score functionality
**Score** 80%
**Reason** PR description is missing or too short

Pull Request Summary:

- **Title**: New Score Functionality
- **Key Changes**:
  - The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to include a call to the `score_pr` function from `summariser.py`. This function calculates a score out of 100 and provides a reason string based on specific characteristics of the Pull Request (PR).
  - The script now prints the score percentage and the reason for the score alongside other PR details when fetching PRs.
  - The score percentage and the reason for the score are now included in the generated release notes for each PR.
- **Impact**: 
  - This PR enhances the existing PR summarisation process by adding a scoring mechanism based on PR characteristics. This can help in understanding the quality and completeness of the PR at a glance.
  - The addition of the score and its reasoning in the release notes further provides valuable insights for those reviewing the release notes, improving the overall understanding and tracking of changes.
- **Note**: This PR does not update external Terraform modules or changes any git tag in a module source; thus, it does not have any direct impact on the infrastructure.
