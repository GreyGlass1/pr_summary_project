# Release Notes for Release-1.2.3

## Repository Update
- The repository name has been updated in the `generate_release_notes.py` file. The name has changed from "GreyGlass1/test_repo" to "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project" (PR #1).

## Codebase Context Embedding
- A new script has been introduced that embeds the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval, using the LlamaIndex library. This is intended for use with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (PR #2).

## PR Summarisation Tool Enhancements
- Significant updates have been made to the `generate_release_notes.py` script. These changes include loading an index from disk, querying this index with the diff text, constructing a prompt using the code context and PR info, and calling OpenAI to generate a summary of the pull request. The OpenAI model used has been switched from "gpt-3.5-turbo" to "gpt-4" (PR #3).
- Enhanced configuration and output features have been added to the PR summarisation tool. This includes the introduction of a `config.py` file for centralized environment and configuration variable management, and the generation of detailed release notes for each tagged PR. A new script, `generate_combined_summary.py`, has been created to generate a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs (PR #4).
- The PR summarisation tool now provides improved error handling for large 'diff' cases, and uses an index from disk to query the 'diff' for relevant code context. The 'max_tokens' parameter for the OpenAI model call has been set to 500, and the 'temperature' parameter has been updated from 0.2 to 0.7 (PR #4).

## Codebase Reorganisation and Enhancements
- The codebase has been reorganised with all Python scripts moved into a new `scripts` folder. This includes the `config.py`, `context_embed.py`, and `generate_release_notes.py` files (PR #5).
- Configurations have been extracted into a separate `config.py` file and the Chroma vector store has been extended for the entire repository (PR #5).

## Potential Risks
- Changes to the `generate_release_notes.py` script and the introduction of the `config.py` file may cause issues if the correct environment variables are not set (PR #3, PR #4, PR #5).
- The switch from the "gpt-3.5-turbo" to the "gpt-4" model for OpenAI may impact the quality and consistency of generated summaries (PR #3, PR #4).
- The reorganisation of the codebase may cause issues if dependencies are not correctly updated to reflect the new file locations (PR #5).
