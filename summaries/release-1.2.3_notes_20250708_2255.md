Title: Embed codebase context for RAG

Summary: The pull request adds a new Python script (`context_embed.py`) to the project. This script uses the LlamaIndex to embed the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval. The script scans the project root for Python files, excluding certain directories (`venv`, `index`, `.git`, `.vscode`), and writes these files into a temporary folder. It then creates a VectorStoreIndex from these documents and persists it in the 'index' subdirectory of the project root.
