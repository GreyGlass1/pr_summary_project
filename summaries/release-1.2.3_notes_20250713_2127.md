### PR #2 - Embed codebase context for RAG
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Title: Embed codebase context for RAG

Summary: This pull request includes a new script named `context_embed.py` which uses LlamaIndex to embed the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval. The script loads the OpenAI API key from the `.env` file, gathers Python files from the project root while excluding certain directories, writes the files into a temporary folder, and then saves the index. This is aimed to improve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by providing context from the codebase.

### PR #3 - no context (test)
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

Pull Request Title: no context (test)

Summary:
This pull request includes updates to the `generate_release_notes.py` script. The changes introduce the feature of loading an index from disk and querying this index with the diff text. The queried context is then used along with the PR's information to construct a prompt. This prompt is then passed to the OpenAI model to generate a summary of the pull request. The OpenAI model version has been updated to "gpt-4". Minor changes include a correction in a print statement and refractor of the summarise_pr function.

### PR #4 - PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

This pull request titled "PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool" provides enhancements to the existing PR summarisation tool. The changes include:

1. A new configuration handling via `config.py` for improved maintainability. 
2. Updates to `generate_release_notes.py` which now creates detailed release notes for each tagged PR. These notes are stored under the `summaries/` directory with timestamped filenames.
3. A new script `generate_combined_summary.py` that generates a single, context-aware summary of all included PRs by using embedded codebase context and OpenAI.

In terms of code changes, the summarisation of pull requests has been updated to include relevant code context in the prompt for OpenAI. The OpenAI model used has been upgraded to gpt-4, the maximum token limit has been increased, and the temperature has been adjusted. 

Additionally, a new configuration file (`config.py`) and a new summariser file (`summariser.py`) have been added. The `generate_release_notes.py` script now uses environment variables for the Github token, OpenAI API key, and repository name. It also creates a summaries directory if it doesn't exist. 

These changes aim to streamline the summary generation process, provide release-specific context, and improve the traceability of outputs.

### PR #5 - enhancements
**Score** 100%
**Reason** High-quality PR with good metadata

This pull request, titled "enhancements", involves modifications in the `config.py` and `context_embed.py` script files. The changes include moving these script files into a new directory named `scripts` and enhancing their functionality. 

In the `config.py` file, additional configurations and paths were added, such as GitHub tokens, API keys, project paths, Confluence details, release tag, and directories to skip during indexing. 

The `context_embed.py` file was updated to read the entire project files and generate an index, with improvements to ensure the index directory is fresh before reading files. 

These changes also involved importing new modules and defining new variables. Overall, 91 lines were added and 64 lines were deleted across 6 files in this pull request.

### PR #6 - new score functionality
**Score** 80%
**Reason** PR description is missing or too short

Pull Request Title: New Score Functionality

This pull request introduces a new function `score_pr` to the `generate_release_notes.py` script. This function calculates a score out of 100 and provides a reason string based on certain PR characteristics. The score and reason for each PR are now included in the release notes generated by the script. The scoring system deducts points if the PR is not merged, lacks a description, does not have labels, or has a generic title. Changes have been made to both the `generate_release_notes.py` and `summariser.py` scripts, with a total of 44 insertions and 4 deletions.
