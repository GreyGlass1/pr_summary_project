# Release Notes for Release-1.2.3

## Repo Update
The repository name used in the `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated. The old repository name "GreyGlass1/test_repo" has been replaced with the new repository name "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project".

## Codebase Context Embedding for RAG
A new script, `context_embed.py`, has been added to the project. This script uses the LlamaIndex to embed the source code of the project into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval. The script locates all Python files in the project root excluding specified directories, writes these files into a temporary directory, and then embeds them into a VectorStoreIndex. The index is then saved for future use.

## Context-Less Test Update
The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to load the index from disk and query the index with the diff text. It now constructs a prompt using the relevant code context and PR information, and uses this prompt to call the OpenAI API for summarising the Pull Request. The model used for the OpenAI API call has been updated to "gpt-4". The function `summarise_pr(pr)` has been significantly expanded to incorporate these changes. A minor correction has also been made to the terminology used in the script.

## PR Summarisation Tool Enhancements
Several improvements have been made to the PR summarisation tool. Configuration enhancements include the centralisation of environment/configuration variable handling in `config.py` for better maintainability. Output enhancements include generating detailed release notes for each tagged PR, storing them under the directory `summaries/` with timestamped filenames. The tool now generates a single context-aware summary of all included PRs by combining embedded codebase context and OpenAI in `generate_combined_summary.py`. The `generate_release_notes.py` script has undergone significant modifications to support these changes.

# Potential Risks
No breaking changes or dependencies have been introduced in this release. However, the changes to the `generate_release_notes.py` script and the addition of the `context_embed.py` script could potentially affect the operation of the PR summarisation tool. It is recommended to thoroughly test the tool after the update.
