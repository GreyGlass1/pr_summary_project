# Release 1.2.3

## Changes

### Repository Name Update
The repository name has been updated from "GreyGlass1/test_repo" to "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project" in the `generate_release_notes.py` file.

### Embed Codebase Context for RAG
A new script (`context_embed.py`) has been added that uses LlamaIndex to semantically embed the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The script loads the OpenAI API key from the `.env` file, gathers Python files from the project root, excluding certain directories, writes them into a temporary folder, and then saves the index.

### Enhancements to PR Summarisation Tool
Significant enhancements have been made to the PR summarisation tool. These include:
- A new `config.py` file for centralised environment/config variable handling.
- Updates to `generate_release_notes.py` to generate detailed release notes for each tagged PR. The notes are stored under the `summaries/` directory with timestamped filenames.
- Addition of `generate_combined_summary.py`, a script that produces a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs using the embedded codebase context and OpenAI.
- Streamlining of summary generation, support for release-specific context, and improved traceability of outputs.

### Project Structure and Functionality Enhancements
Changes have been made to the structure and functionality of the project. The configuration was extracted into a separate `config.py` file, and the python scripts were moved into a new `scripts` folder. The `context_embed.py` script now has the ability to read files and generate an index for the entire repository. The `config.py` and `context_embed.py` scripts in the root directory were deleted, and new versions were created within the `scripts` directory. The `generate_release_notes.py` script was also moved to the `scripts` directory.

### New Score Functionality
A new functionality has been introduced that calculates a score out of 100 for each pull request based on specific characteristics of the PR such as whether it has been merged, the length and content of the PR body, the presence of labels, and the title of the PR. The score and a reason string explaining the scoring are displayed.

## Potential Risks
The changes made to the scripts and the movement of these scripts into a new directory could potentially cause issues if the paths are not updated correctly in all places where they are referenced. The new scoring functionality is also based on several factors, and any changes to these factors could impact the scoring process.
