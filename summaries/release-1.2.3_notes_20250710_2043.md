# üìù Release Notes for release-1.2.3

### PR #1 - update repo
Pull Request Title: Update repo

Summary: This pull request updates the repository name used in the `generate_release_notes.py` script. The old repository name "GreyGlass1/test_repo" is replaced by a new repository name "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project".

### PR #2 - Embed codebase context for RAG
Title: Embed codebase context for RAG

Summary: This pull request includes the addition of a script that uses the LlamaIndex to embed the source code of the project into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval. The new script, context_embed.py, locates all Python files in the project root excluding specified directories, and then writes these files into a temporary directory. The files are then embedded into a VectorStoreIndex and the index is saved. The changes only involve the addition of this new script, with 37 lines of code added in total.

### PR #3 - no context (test)
Title: No context (test)

This Pull Request involves changes in the `generate_release_notes.py` script. The new changes introduce the functionality of loading the index from disk and querying the index with the diff text. It also constructs a prompt using the relevant code context and PR information. This prompt is then used to call OpenAI API for summarising the Pull Request. The model used for the OpenAI API call has been updated to "gpt-4". Furthermore, the function `summarise_pr(pr)` has been significantly expanded to incorporate these changes. An incorrect term "Marged" was corrected to "Merged".

### PR #4 - PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool
This pull request, titled "PR introduces configuration and output enhancements to the PR summarisation tool", incorporates several improvements to the PR summarisation tool. The improvements are as follows:

1. Configuration enhancements include the centralisation of environment/configuration variable handling in `config.py` for better maintainability. 

2. Output enhancements include generating detailed release notes for each tagged PR, storing them under the directory `summaries/` with timestamped filenames. 

3. The pull request also involves the creation of a single context-aware summary of all included PRs by combining embedded codebase context and OpenAI in `generate_combined_summary.py`. 

In terms of code changes, the script `generate_release_notes.py` undergoes significant modifications. Notably, the code now loads an index from the disk, queries the index with the diff, constructs a prompt using code context and PR info, and calls OpenAI. The output is more context-aware and detailed. 

Additionally, two new files are created: `config.py` for centralised environment/config variable handling, and `summariser.py` for generating combined release summaries. 

These changes aim to streamline summary generation, support release-specific context, and improve the traceability of outputs.
