# ðŸš€ Combined Release Summary for release-1.2.3

# Release Notes for Release-1.2.3

## Update Repo
The repository name within the file `generate_release_notes.py` has been updated. The previous name "GreyGlass1/test_repo" has been replaced with the new name "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project". This change was made by the user `teaton12`.

## Embed Codebase Context for RAG
A new script, `context_embed.py`, has been introduced. This script uses the LlamaIndex library to embed the project's source code into a Chroma vector store, allowing for semantic retrieval of the code. The script gathers all .py files from the project root, excluding specific directories, and writes the matching .py files into a temporary folder. The vector index is then created from these documents and saved.

## No Context (Test)
Updates have been made to the 'generate_release_notes.py' script. These updates include loading the index from disk and querying this index using the diff text to gather relevant context. This context, along with the Pull Request title, body, and diff text, is used to call OpenAI for summarization using the GPT-4 model with specific message roles and parameters. Minor updates such as typo corrections have also been made.

# Potential Risks
There are no identified breaking changes or dependencies in this release. However, as with any changes, there may be unforeseen impacts or dependencies. It is recommended to thoroughly test all changes in a controlled environment before deploying to production.
