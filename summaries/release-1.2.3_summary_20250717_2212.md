# Release Notes for Version 1.2.3

## Summary

This release introduces significant enhancements to the `generate_release_notes.py` script, improves codebase organization, and adds new functionalities to increase the efficiency of handling PRs and the quality of indexing and retrieving information from the codebase.

## Detailed Notes

### PR Summarization Tool Enhancements
- The repository name for the `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project" for accurate generation and retrieval of release notes (#1).
- The script now loads an index from disk and uses the diff text from the PR to query the loaded index, allowing for code context extraction (#3).
- The prompt construction for PR summaries has been improved to include relevant code context in addition to the PR title, body, and diff (#3).
- The script now utilizes the "gpt-4" OpenAI model instead of "gpt-3.5-turbo" for generating PR summaries, potentially leading to more accurate and detailed summaries (#3).
- A new function `score_pr` has been added that calculates a score for each PR based on certain characteristics. This could potentially help prioritize PRs based on their scores, thereby improving efficiency in handling PRs (#5, #6).

### Codebase Organization and Configuration Handling
- Configuration has been extracted and placed into a separate `config.py` file, improving codebase maintainability and readability by centralizing all configuration-related code (#5).
- Python scripts have been moved into a `scripts` folder, enhancing codebase organization and making it easier to navigate (#5).

### Codebase Context Embedding
- A script has been added that integrates the project source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval using LlamaIndex (#2).
- The `context_embed.py` script has been extended to store vectors for the entire repository, improving the quality of indexing and retrieving information from the codebase (#5).

### External Modules Embedding
- The codebase now scans for external modules, reviews the git diff, and pulls those tags locally, providing more context to the summarizing agent (#7).

### Documentation
- The project's README.md file has been significantly updated to provide a clearer, more detailed description of the project's purpose, key features, function, and setup (#8).

## Potential Risks
- The switch to the "gpt-4" model could impact the runtime and resource utilization, but it is expected to result in better PR summaries (#3, #4).
- If there are dependencies on the original location of the python scripts or the `config.py` file, you may need to update the dependencies to reflect the new locations (#5).
- The vector store extension for the entire repo could potentially require more storage space. Ensure you have enough resources to handle this change (#5).
- Changes to external Terraform modules have potential implications on the infrastructure. Any changes in the external modules could potentially affect the infrastructure components defined by these modules (#7).
