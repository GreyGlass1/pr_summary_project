# Release Notes for 1.2.3

## Repository Update
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to reflect the new repository name "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project", replacing the old repository name "GreyGlass1/test_repo".

## Embed Codebase Context for RAG
- A new script has been added to the project that uses LlamaIndex to embed the project's source code into a Chroma vector store for semantic retrieval. This is part of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process. The script identifies all Python files in the project, excluding specified directories, and stores this data into a temporary folder. This data is then embedded into the Chroma vector index and saved.

## Generate Release Notes Update
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to include new functionalities such as loading an index from disk, querying the index with relevant context, constructing a prompt using code context and PR information, and calling OpenAI to generate a summary of the pull request. 
- Minor changes include the correction of a typo ('Marged' to 'Merged') and the adjustment of parameters in the call to the OpenAI model.

## PR Summarisation Tool Enhancements
- The script that generates release notes for GitHub pull requests has been updated to include a new `config.py` file for centralised environment/config variable handling to improve maintainability. 
- The `generate_release_notes.py` script now generates detailed release notes for each tagged PR, stored under `summaries/` with timestamped filenames.
- A new script `generate_combined_summary.py` has been introduced that produces a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs using embedded codebase context and OpenAI.

## Potential Risks
- The changes made to the `generate_release_notes.py` script, especially the call to OpenAI's GPT-4 model, may affect the performance and output of the script. It is recommended to thoroughly test the updated script to ensure it functions as expected.
- The introduction of `config.py` for centralized configuration may affect other parts of the codebase that rely on environment variables. It is important to verify that all dependencies have been updated to use the new configuration file.
