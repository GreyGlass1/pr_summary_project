# Release Notes for Version 1.2.3

## Summary
This release introduces several enhancements to the pull request summarisation tool, aiming to improve its utility, maintainability, and traceability of outputs. The release also includes a new feature that embeds the project's codebase into a Chroma vector index for semantic retrieval, significantly enhancing code search and navigation. Additionally, a scoring mechanism has been added to the summarisation process, providing insights into the quality and completeness of each PR.

## Details

### Update Repo [#1](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/1)
The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to fetch data from the correct repository, "GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project". This change ensures the accuracy of the generated release notes.

### Embed Codebase Context for RAG [#2](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/2)
A new script, `context_embed.py`, has been introduced to enable the embedding of the project's codebase into a Chroma vector index for semantic retrieval. This enhancement improves code navigation and search capabilities.

### No Context (Test) [#3](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/3)
The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been improved with an index loading functionality from the disk and querying of the diff text for relevant code context. This update, along with the use of a new OpenAI model, "gpt-4", enhances the generation of context-aware summaries for the pull requests.

### PR Summarisation Tool Enhancements [#4](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/4)
Several enhancements have been introduced to the PR summarisation tool, including the centralisation of environment and configuration variable handling, storage of detailed release notes for each tagged PR in timestamped files, and the production of a single, context-aware summary across all included PRs.

### Codebase Organization Enhancements [#5](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/5)
The `config.py` and `context_embed.py` files, along with other scripts, have been moved to a new `scripts` directory to improve the codebase structure and navigability. The `context_embed.py` script has also been updated to read and index the entire repository.

### New Score Functionality [#6](https://github.com/GreyGlass1/pr_summary_project/pull/6)
The `generate_release_notes.py` script has been updated to include a call to the `score_pr` function from `summariser.py`. This function calculates a score out of 100 and provides a reason string based on specific characteristics of the PR, enhancing the PR summarisation process.

## Potential Risks
While this release does not involve changes to any external Terraform modules or git tags in a module source, it is crucial to ensure the updated repository contains all the necessary code and modules to be reflected in the release notes. Also, careful management of directories excluded from the indexing process is necessary to ensure relevant code is not unintentionally overlooked.
